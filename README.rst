termstyle
===========
This module is created to bring extremely easy to use terminal colours and styles.
The official terminal module also does this but requires you to use calls like
``setStyle`` which clutters your input. This module on the other hand just defines
simple, single-word procedures that applies styles to everything that follows.
The most simple example is a regular ``echo`` statement for logging. To style it
with a red text colour simply do:
::
  echo red "mystring"
This allows you to easily drop it into any echo statement without trouble.
Similarily to an echo it also takes varargs, so this would also work:
::
  echo red("mystring", 42)
It even converts the integer to a string when concatenating just like echo does!
If you want to have multiple colours on a single line you can use multiple of
them and the ``echo`` varargs system:
::
  echo red "This is blue: ", blue 42
In case you want to add more styles and don't want to chain them you can of
course also use the ``style`` procedure and combine the various styles:
::
  echo style("mystring", termRed & termBlink)
